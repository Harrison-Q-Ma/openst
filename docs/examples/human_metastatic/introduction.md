# Introduction

In our paper, we used a human metastatic lymph node sample to benchmark the reproducibility and efficiency of Open-ST for 3D reconstruction.

We profiled patient-matched samples from human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), due to the interesting transcriptional diversity and spatial organization. For the human metastatic lymph node, we applied Open-ST to serial sections spanning 350 Î¼m. We constructed a 3D virtual tissue block with over a million cells and hundreds of millions of transcripts embedded in the H&E stainings. 

In the following sections, we explore how to reproduce the (pre)processing for these data.

These steps are introduced in our [_STAR Protocols_ paper](https://www.cell.com/star-protocols/home). The data is described in our [Open-ST paper, in _Cell_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.05.055).
