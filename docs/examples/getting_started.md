# Examples

Here you will find datasets generated in the [Rajewsky lab @ MDC Berlin](https://www.mdc-berlin.de/n-rajewsky)
leveraging the **Open-ST** workflow (experimental and computational). 

_We will add all (clean) notebooks from the preprint soon!_

## Datasets

We provide raw data, instructions on how to reproduce the preprocessing pipeline, the corresponding preprocessed
data (for comparison), and notebooks for some exploratory visualization and downstream analysis. You can find
human and mouse datasets.
