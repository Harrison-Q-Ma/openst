# Welcome to Open-ST Documentation

**Open-ST** is a high-resolution spatial transcriptomics method that aims to democratize spatial transcriptomics by making it accessible to any laboratory.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to both the [experimental](about.md) and [computational](about.md) protocols involved in Open-ST.

You can find our preprint in [bioRxiv](https://biorxiv.org).

## The Protocol

**Open-ST** leverages ...

We provide [our custom 3D-printable tool](index.md) for cutting the flow cell into small capture areas, optimizing cost per sample.
