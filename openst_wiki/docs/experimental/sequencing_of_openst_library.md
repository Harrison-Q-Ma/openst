# Sequencing of open-ST library

We recommend quantifying your libraries for sequencing using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit. 
The optimal loading concentration depends on the sequencer used. For the Illumina® **NovaSeq 6000** we obtained optimal clustering at a loading concentration of **130 pM**. For the Illumina® **NextSeq 2000** sequencing system we recommend a loading concentration of **650 pM**.   
Moreover, Illumina suggests a minimum of 1% PhiX into the pool as a qality control for cluster generation, sequencing, and alignment. 

The following read lengths were used :
