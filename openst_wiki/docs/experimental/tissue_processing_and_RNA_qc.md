# Tissue processing and RNA quality control 

Open-ST requires the use of unfixed fresh-frozen tissue. We recommend following 10X Visium's protocol for simultaneous freezing and embedding in their [Tissue Preparation guide](https://cdn.10xgenomics.com/image/upload/v1695417744/support-documents/CG000240_Demonstrated_Protocol_VisiumSpatialProtocols_TissuePreparationGuide_RevE.pdf)
Test for RNA quality of the OCT-embedded tissue before working with a tissue. Aim for an RNA integrity number (RIN) over 6.
